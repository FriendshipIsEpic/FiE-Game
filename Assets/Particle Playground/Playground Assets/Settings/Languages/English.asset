  threadMethodDescription: Determines which multithreading method should be used.
  maxThreads: Max Threads
  maxThreadsDescription: The maximum amount of threads that can be created. The amount
    of created threads will never exceed available CPUs.
  threadInfo01: No calculation threads will be created. This will in most cases have
    a negative impact on performance as Particle Playground will calculate along all
    other logic on the main-thread. Use this for debug purposes or if you know there's
    no multi- or hyperthreading possibilities on your target platform.
  threadInfo02: One calculation thread per particle system will be created. Use this
    when having heavy particle systems in your scene. Note that this method will never
    bundle calculation calls.
  threadInfo03: One calculation thread for all particle systems will be created. Use
    this if you have other multithreaded logic which has higher performance priority
    than Particle Playground or your project demands strict use of garbage collection.
  threadInfo04: Calculation threads will distribute evenly for all particle systems
    in your scene. This will bundle calculation calls to match the platform's SystemInfo.processorCount.
    This is the recommended and overall fastest method to calculate particle systems.
