# Friendship is Epic

Free and Open-Source, just to show that once it's on the internet you can never get rid of it.

This is continuation of the unity game "Friendship is Epic" that was famously lost when the original developer
when missing in action (and took the only copy of the project, the code, and assets with him).

This project is a reconstruction of that original game's source code and assets, using the released 
developer build as a starting point to resume work on a game that deserved to be finished.

## Credits

Credits for the original project and ideas goes to the late helements and the Japanese FiE team
Sound effects and music credit to Jyc Row.
